Working through Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition (CLRS) in Python with Jupyter Notebook

_Chapters 1 through 11_ will be covered by notebooks in this repo.

Later chapters are specific to languages and domains other than Python and will be covered in another repo.

This is a work in progress. This repo serves as a journal for my progress through this book.
